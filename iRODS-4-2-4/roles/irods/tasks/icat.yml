#Notes about this module:
#It reads left to right, matching strings up to the ":"
#This means "iRODS service account" matches "iRODS service account name"
#The ":" separates the line to search for from the response to enter. Response should be quoted.
#Lines do not need to be in order. As a prompt occurs, it will search the list to find a match.
#(?i)TEXTGOESHERE before a line will ignore case.
#So in short:
#(?i)this is my query, ignoring case \[and escaped properly\] : "THIS IS MY RESPONSE, on the other side of the colon"
